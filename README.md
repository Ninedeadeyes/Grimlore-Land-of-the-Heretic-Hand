# Grimlore-Land-of-the-Heretic-Hand 1.18
2D Open world ASCII rpg written in standard Library Python delivering an old school rpg experience. <br>

Is it the best open world rpg you have ever played ? Probably not but is it the best open world rpg you ever played coded in python 3 just using the standard library ? ( Potentially )  

A hand reaches out from a shallow grave...That hand is yours.. You gasp for air as you free yourself. The only thing you can remember is your name.
You see a wood sign pointing south east label 'Beggar's Hole'. Maybe you will find some answers there or at least a safe place to sleep <br>

Explore the land of the Heretic Hand and unravel the mystery of your past. Craft powerful weapons from the broken bodies of your enemies. Choose between 3 Class paths ( Shadow Hunter, Holy Knight and the Doom Wizard) each with their unique play style. Test your might in the Blood Pits of Telpo, complete bounty hunts called 'Blood Contracts' to gain reputation and other delightful rewards. After all that, if you think you are 'hard' enough challenge the Doom King of the Heretic Hand and free the land of his consuming darkness.

  <summary> STARTER GUIDE (Spoiler Warning)</summary><br>
  
* From the starting position, travel southeast to the first settlement (‘Beggar's Hole’).<br>
* At your first settlement, you can rest at the inn to regain HP and Mana.<br>
* Once you've saved enough gold, visit the temple to buy the item ‘Resurrection Talisman’.<br>
* Though optional, it is highly recommended to buy at least the two spells from this temple: Fire Bolt and Shadow Flee.<br>
* The first dungeon is northeast of ‘Beggar's Hole’, and it's called the Temple of Apshai.<br>
* You can grind this dungeon until you’ve saved enough gold and materials to purchase weapons and armour from the blacksmith in the settlement.<br>
* The enemies within each dungeon determine the materials you gain after defeating them, so you’ll need to grind specific dungeons for specific materials.<br>
* At every new settlement you discover, spend some coins at the inn to reveal tips, new locations and to progress.<br>
* After completing a ‘Blood Contract’, return to the inn where you received the quest to claim your reward.<br>
* Don’t forget to equip your new weapon or armour once you've purchased it.<br>
* When travelling on the over world map, if you press M and Enter you can change the music and N and Enter to stop the music. <br>
