# GrimeLore-Land-of-the-Heretic-Hand 1.0
2D Open world ASCII rpg written in standard Library Python 


is this the best open world rpg you have ever played ? Probably not but is it the best open world rpg you ever played coded in python 3 just using the standard library ? ( Potentially yes.. ) 

A hand reaches out from a shallow grave...That hand is yours.. You gasp for air as you free yourself. The only thing you can remember is your name
You see a wood sign pointing south east label 'Beggar's Hole'. Maybe you will find some answers there or at least a safe place to sleep

Explore the land of the Heretic Hand and find out the mystery of your past. Craft powerful weapons from the broken bodies of your enemies. Choose between 3 Class paths ( Shadow Hunter, Holy Knight and the Doom Wizard) each with their unique play style. Test your might in the Blood Pits of Telpo, complete Bounty Hunts called 'Blood Contracts' to gain reputation and other delightful rewards. After all that, if you think you are 'hard' enough challenge the Doom king of the Heretic Hand and free the land of darkness. 


Note:

Most likely I will be updating the game, even though complete, it still need some polishing. Will be grateful with any feedback to improve the game. I will also be uploading up a  'game engine' version so people can make their own games if they like.
